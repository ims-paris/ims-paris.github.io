        Duns Scotus traveled to and from Paris several times. He was greatly influenced 
        by its intellectual environment, and its University.<br>
        <br>
        Between his religious profession and his ordination, from 1281 to 1291, 
        Duns Scotus was obliged to pursue his first philosophical and theological 
        studies.<br>
        <br>
        Where, and under whose influences? Who were his teachers, those likely 
        to leave an imprint and help shape his thought?<br>
        <br>
        There is no documentary evidence concerning that period. Hence, let us 
        hypothesize that he studied at least two or three years in the convent 
        of his Province, as it was customary, namely at Haddington in Scotland, 
        and later at Oxford, in England. Nevertheless, Duns Scotus shows a rather 
        Parisian and French training in philosophy and theology. He is a metaphysician 
        and a theologian in the tradition of Paris and its great magistri, e.g. 
        Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. Moreover, Duns Scotus&#8217;s first writings 
        in logic and metaphysics reflect the intellectual atmosphere of Paris. 
        Perhaps Duns Scotus went to Paris at the beginning of his career and remained 
        there between 1283 and 1290. If we accept this hypothesis, several problems 
        associated with the origin and formulation of Scotus&#8217;s ideas would 
        find a solution, because we could assume that Duns Scotus knew Richard 
        of Mediaville, Peter Olivi, Gonsalvus Hispanus, along with other masters 
        of the time, all of whom taught in Paris.<br>
        <br>
        John Duns Scotus was ordained to the priesthood in Northampton, England, 
        on March 17th, 1291, and then he went to Paris (1292-1293) for his higher 
        theological studies. There Duns Scotus read Peter Lombard&#8217;s Sentences, 
        took part in disputations, and delivered sermons. About 1297, he returned 
        to England to complete at Oxford and perhaps at Cambridge his studies 
        for the doctorate. He was back in Paris in 1301, as master of theology. 
        Expelled from France in 1303, he was allowed to return to Paris in 1304, 
        where he remained until 1307.<br>
        <br>
        Duns Scotus developed his theological synthesis in Paris, at least for 
        the most part: it is Augustinian in its general outlines, Franciscan in 
        its details, aware of Aristotle&#8217;s philosophy and Aquinas&#8217;s 
        teachings, in a sort of balanced via media between Augustinianism and 
        Aristotelianism. Duns Scotus shows a tendency to unify and set in order, 
        avoiding separatist compromises: Scotum consulat qui amat unitatem doctrinae.</font></p>
