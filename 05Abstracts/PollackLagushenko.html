      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Little 
        is known about the households of southern French aristocrats for the period 
        between the Albigensian crusade and the union of the houses of Albret 
        and Bourbon in the sixteenth century. This paper uses fiscal sources to 
        reconstruct life in the household of Bernard VII, count of Armagnac (reigned 
        1391-1418), who played an important political and military role in the 
        later phases of the Hundred Years&#8217; War. On a daily basis, the count&#8217;s 
        household brought together one to two hundred residents and visitors, 
        and over the course of a year as many as five hundred individuals spent 
        some time at the count&#8217;s table. The available evidence suggests 
        that this represented substantial growth relative to the southern courts 
        frequented by the troubadours during the twelfth century. On the eve of 
        the fifteenth century, the counts of Armagnac assumed unprecedented roles 
        as both regional power-brokers and as actors in aristocratic intrigues 
        dividing the royal family. A prosopographical analysis shows that men 
        who dined with Bernard VII at the end of the fourteenth century, whether 
        or not he was their lord, went on to serve in his military household during 
        the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War (1410-1435). The household served to 
        broaden the count&#8217;s contacts beyond the circle of his direct vassals.

        This paper also considers the cultural and political roles of women within 
        the households of the Armagnac family. Like other southern aristocrats, 
        the counts of Armagnac looked increasingly to the Francophone north for 
        their wives and the partners for their children. Women like Bonne de Berry 
        seemed to have assisted, or perhaps even promoted, two types of transformations. 
        First, breaking with an important southern tradition, the count&#8217;s 
        wife avoided direct and independent involvement in comital government, 
        even though the outbreak of the civil war required that many important 
        decisions be made in Bernard VII&#8217;s absence. Second, Bonne seems 
        to have preferred to confine her activities to the familial, cultural 
        and religious spheres. As governance and counsel became more clearly a 
        masculine activity, women focused their energies on the intimate side 
        of familial life and on the cultural networks that governed the life of 
        the court.</font></p>
